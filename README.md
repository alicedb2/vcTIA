# vcTIA - Voltage Controlled TIA chip

The XTAL circuit may be different depending on which Atari 2600 version/revision it was pulled from.
Mine was the XTAL that came with TIA C010444-01 and I had to use the circuit at the top of the 2600A Rev14/15 motherboard schematics rather than the one appearing on the TIA MIDIbox schematics.
